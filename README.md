synology-decrypt
================

An open source implementation of the Synology Cloudsync Decryption tool.
This can be used to decrypt files encrypted using Synology Cloudsync when uploading from a Network Attached Storage device to a cloud provider.

This still needs packaging as a binary package, so that I can offer releases and instructions.
